## 📌 Summary

<!-- One-line description of the refactor -->

## 🧩 Context

<!-- What part of the system to refactor (e.g., session engine, tag logic, dashboard, etc.) -->

## 🔄 Refactor Motivation

**Current State:**
<!-- What's the current implementation? -->

**Issues with Current Code:**
<!-- Why does it need refactoring? (complexity, duplication, etc.) -->

**Proposed Approach:**
<!-- How will the refactor improve the code? -->

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Extract helpers/utilities
- [ ] Reduce function complexity
- [ ] Improve naming and structure
- [ ] Ensure tests still pass
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## 💡 Why This Matters

<!-- Explain benefits: maintainability, testability, readability, etc. -->

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

- [ ] No behavior changes (pure refactor)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to API

## 🔀 Suggested Branch
