## Detailed Description (4000 chars max, current: ~3850 chars)

Stop grinding LeetCode randomly. Start learning algorithms scientifically.

CodeMaster is an intelligent learning assistant that transforms your algorithm practice into a personalized, retention-optimized system. Unlike traditional problem lists, CodeMaster uses proven cognitive science principles to ensure you actually master algorithms—not just solve them once and forget.

### 🧠 SMART SPACED REPETITION

Never forget a pattern you've learned. Our Leitner-based system automatically schedules problem reviews at scientifically optimal intervals:

• **5-Box Progression System**: Problems advance through mastery levels (Daily → Every 3 days → Weekly → Monthly → Archived)
• **FSRS Algorithm Integration**: Personalized forgetting curves adapt to YOUR individual learning pace
• **Intelligent Review Scheduling**: Due problems surface automatically—no manual tracking needed
• **Decay-Aware Tracking**: Problems you haven't seen in months get prioritized to refresh your memory

Returns from a 2-year break? CodeMaster knows what you've forgotten and rebuilds your foundation efficiently.

### 📊 ADAPTIVE LEARNING ENGINE

Your sessions evolve with your performance:

• **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Problems get harder as you improve, easier when you struggle
• **Pattern Ladder System**: Master algorithms progressively within each category (Arrays → Two Pointers → Sliding Window → Advanced)
• **Tag Mastery Tracking**: See exactly which topics you've mastered and which need work across 50+ algorithm patterns
• **Multi-Factor Problem Selection**: 9+ criteria analyzed to choose optimal next problems (mastery level, recent performance, learning velocity, weak areas)

No more guessing which problem to do next. CodeMaster always knows.

### 🎯 SEAMLESS LEETCODE INTEGRATION

Practice on LeetCode, track progress in CodeMaster:

• **Automatic Problem Capture**: Click one button to log attempts—no manual data entry
• **Built-In Timer**: Track time spent without switching tabs
• **Smart Hint System**: 50+ algorithm-specific strategy guides with progressive hint disclosure
• **Content Script Overlay**: Lightweight interface floats on LeetCode pages—zero friction

Works on every LeetCode problem page. No account linking required.

### 📈 INSIGHTFUL ANALYTICS DASHBOARD

Data-driven progress tracking that actually helps:

• **Tag Mastery Heatmaps**: Visualize strengths and weaknesses across algorithm categories
• **Box Distribution Charts**: See your retention pipeline at a glance
• **Session History Analytics**: Accuracy trends, time-per-problem metrics, productivity insights
• **Learning Velocity Tracking**: Measure improvement rate per topic
• **Pattern Coverage Reports**: Ensure balanced topic exposure (70% ladder completion requirement)

Turn vague "I should do more DP" into concrete "I'm 60% through DP Easy, 30% Medium—here's what to focus on."

### 🔒 PRIVACY-FIRST DESIGN

Your learning data belongs to you:

• **100% Local Storage**: All data stays on your device via IndexedDB
• **Zero Cloud Dependencies**: No servers, no accounts, no tracking
• **No Data Transmission**: Extension never sends anything anywhere
• **Complete Control**: Export, delete, or reset your data anytime

We can't see your data because we never collect it.

### 🚀 PERFECT FOR

**Interview Prep**: Spaced repetition ensures long-term retention, not short-term cramming

**Returning Users**: Studied 4 months → Got job → Interviewing again 2 years later? Start where you left off with intelligent recalibration

**Structured Learners**: Pattern ladders provide clear progression paths through algorithm topics

**Data Enthusiasts**: Detailed analytics show exactly where your time is best spent

**Busy Professionals**: Adaptive sessions optimize learning efficiency—no wasted time on topics you've mastered

### ⚡ KEY FEATURES AT A GLANCE

✅ Leitner spaced repetition with FSRS stability tracking
✅ Adaptive session generation based on real-time performance
✅ 50+ algorithm pattern categories with curated strategy guides
✅ Progressive hint system (pattern → strategy → optimization)
✅ Comprehensive analytics dashboard with Recharts visualizations
✅ LeetCode content script integration with timer
✅ Pattern ladder progression with difficulty scaling
✅ Tag mastery engine with decay score tracking
✅ Session history with productivity insights
✅ Focus area customization and learning goal setting

✅ Dark mode support

### 📚 SCIENCE-BACKED LEARNING

Based on research-proven principles:

• **Spaced Repetition**: Review at optimal intervals (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve)
• **Graduated Difficulty**: Start easy, increase challenge as competence grows (Zone of Proximal Development)
• **Interleaved Practice**: Mix topics to improve discrimination and retention
• **Retrieval Practice**: Active recall strengthens memory more than re-reading solutions

CodeMaster applies learning science to software engineering education.

### 🎓 WHO BENEFITS MOST

• Students preparing for technical interviews at FAANG companies
• Self-taught developers building algorithmic foundations
• Bootcamp graduates strengthening computer science fundamentals
• Professionals returning to interviewing after years in a role
