Given that your application focuses on **mastering coding exercises** using the **Leitner system**, here are some key **metrics** you can track and display in a **dashboard** to showcase learning progress and improvements:

---

### **1. User Performance Metrics**

- **Total Problems Solved** 📊  
    → Count of problems completed over time.
- **Average Time Per Problem** ⏱  
    → Tracks how long a user takes to solve problems, aiming for a decrease.
- **Success Rate (%)** ✅  
    → Ratio of problems solved correctly vs. attempts.
- **Accuracy Trend** 📈  
    → Change in accuracy over time (last 7/30 days).
- **Streak Tracker** 🔥  
    → Number of consecutive days/weeks the user is solving problems.

---

### **2. Leitner System Metrics**

- **Box Distribution** 📦  
    → Number of problems in each box level (e.g., Box 1 = just learned, Box 5 = mastered).
- **Promotion & Demotion Trends** 📊  How would your Visualize that ? 
    → Problems that moved up or down boxes over time.
- **Mastery Percentage (%)** 🏆  -> # number of problems mastered 
    → % of problems in the highest box.


---

### **3. Learning Insights**

- **Topic Mastery Progress** 📚  
    → Progress tracking per topic (Recursion, DP, Graphs, etc.).
- **New Concepts Learned** 🧠  
    → Highlights new concepts introduced per week/month.

----------------
*Disregarding for now as we would have to capture user's submissions* 
### **4. Coding Efficiency Metrics**

- **Typing Speed (WPM) Over Time** ⌨️  
    → If your app tracks user typing speed during coding.
- **Most Common Mistakes** ⚠️  
    → Repeated mistakes in problem-solving (e.g., syntax errors, logic errors).
- **Problem Difficulty Analysis** 🏋🏽  
    → Breakdown of problems solved by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    - **Code Complexity Trends** ⚡  
    → If analyzing user solutions, track efficiency (e.g., Big-O).

---

### **5. Custom Session Metrics**

- **Average Session Length** ⏳  
    → How long a user spends per session.
- **Session Frequency** 📅  
    → Number of sessions per day/week.
- **Peak Productivity Time** 🕒  
    → When the user is most active.

---
### **6. Tags : Category Mastery**

- **Category Mastery**
	→ How many problems in category that were solved on the first try. Wouldn't that indicate mastery
    →  Spread how many problems under each topic a problem can have multiple topics 
    → I think there should also be a metric for the movements of problems for example if a problem is moving upwards in boxlevel on a certain tag that might indicate a level of understanding of the category it might use the problems on first try metric to get like a growth or regression metric 

### **Dashboard Visualizations**

To present this data effectively:

- **Line Graphs** → Progression of accuracy, problem-solving speed.
- **Bar Charts** → Box distribution, difficulty levels solved.
- **Heatmaps** → Best learning times & consistency streaks.
- **Pie Charts** → Topic mastery & problem difficulty breakdown.
