Based on the images you uploaded, here are some **organizational improvements and changes** you could make to your dashboard:

---

### **1. Page Grouping and Structure Improvements**

Your sidebar currently has:

- **Dashboard**
    - Stats
    - Reports
    - Goals
- **Analytics**
    - Progress
    - Conversions
    - Sources
- **Account**
    - Profile
    - Settings
    - Notifications
- **Settings**
    - General
    - Appearance
    - Accessibility

#### **Suggested Refinements**

- **Merge "Stats" and "Progress" into one section**  
    Since both relate to tracking performance, keep them under **"Dashboard"**:
    
    - **Dashboard**
        
        - **Stats**  (General performance summary):
	         - Include **graphical visualizations** (e.g., problem accuracy, time spent per session).
	         - Show **weekly & monthly progress comparisons**.
        - **Progress** :
	        - Focus on **Leitner system tracking** (box promotions/demotions).
	        - Show **streak tracking & improvement trends**.
        - **Goals  (Tracking goals)
	        - Add **customizable goal settings** for users (e.g., "Solve 50 problems this month").
	        - Show **goal completion percentages**.
    
    - **Analytics**
        - **Performance Trends** (Historical graphs & insights)
        - **Mistake Analysis** (Common errors & improvements)

    - **Account**
            - Profile
