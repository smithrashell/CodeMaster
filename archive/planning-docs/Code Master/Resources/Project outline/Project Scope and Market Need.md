Your idea of integrating the Leitner system with coding practice, particularly from sites like LeetCode, is quite innovative. Let's break down your concept and address each point:

1. **Utility and Market Need**:
    - Many learners find it challenging to revisit and reinforce coding problems they've previously struggled with.
    - Leveraging a spaced repetition system (like the Leitner system) would help learners reinforce their weak areas more effectively.
    - Many coding enthusiasts and professionals use platforms like LeetCode to practice, but they often don't have an efficient system to review their weak points.
2. **Uniqueness**:
    - As of my last update in September 2021, I'm not aware of any Chrome extension or tool that combines the Leitner system with coding problem platforms like LeetCode.
    - There are some separate tools and platforms that use the Leitner system for learning, like Anki, but they are not integrated with coding problem platforms.
3. **Chrome Extension Capabilities**:
    - You want the Chrome extension to capture data such as time taken, whether the problem was solved or not, etc. This is feasible but may require permission from users and has to be GDPR compliant.
    - Ensure you don’t breach any terms of service of platforms like LeetCode. Scraping data without permission or in ways that are against platform terms could lead to legal troubles.
4. **Flashcards and Coding Challenges**:
    - Your idea of integrating coding challenges within flashcards is innovative. It's a mixture of active recall (which flashcards are good for) and actual coding practice.
    - Using a tool like ChatGPT to generate cards based on outlines could be a good way to scale and personalize the learning experience.
5. **Marketability**:
    - Your tool could fill a niche market need. Especially for those who prepare for technical interviews, there's a constant demand for effective and efficient study tools.
    - However, for it to be marketable, it needs to have a polished user interface, reliable functionality, and proper marketing.
6. **Potential Challenges**:
    - **Integration**: Make sure you can reliably and legally obtain the necessary data from platforms like LeetCode.
    - **Content Creation**: Generating flashcards or min coding challenges that are both relevant and of high quality.
    - **User Trust**: As you're capturing user data, you'll need to ensure privacy and build trust.
7. **Recommendations**:
    - Start by validating the idea with a small group. Maybe create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and get feedback.
    - Once validated, and if you're sure it's not breaching any terms of service, you can start building the full version.
    - Consider collaborating with content creators who can help craft high-quality challenges and flashcards.
    - Look into ways to ensure data privacy and maybe even provide offline functionalities to build user trust.

In summary, if executed well, this could be a valuable tool for coding enthusiasts, students, and professionals. It bridges the gap between active practice and spaced repetition, which is not a common combination in the current market. However, always ensure you're operating legally and ethically, and prioritize user trust.
