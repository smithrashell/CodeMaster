CodeMaster Is a application that can be used to track the progress of learning using the Leitner methodology.  Every problem that gets attempted gets is categorized and mapped to review date. 
The problems are evaluated through their relationship with each other and other user input to create a session. That session has  attempted problems and problems that have not been attempted. 
Depending on user progress the problem in session are adjusted. The aim of this application to optimize learning through spaced repetition. With this extension you can expect to learn patterns and solve problems quicker.


Please note we have generated out problem relationships and tags bases off of the problems that have been exposed in the https://leetcode.com/api/problems/algorithms/ endpoint  .
