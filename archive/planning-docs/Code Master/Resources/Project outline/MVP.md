Absolutely! Creating an MVP is about stripping down your product idea to its core, essential features to test the fundamental hypothesis. Given the description of your product, here's a suggested step-by-step breakdown of the elements you'd need for an MVP:

1. **Problem Capture & Timer**:
    - Since you already have a basic version of this, refine it to make sure it captures the data reliably.
    - Ensure that it's user-friendly and intuitive.
2. **Simple Database or Local Storage**:
    - For an MVP, you don't necessarily need a complex backend. You can store user data (like problems attempted, success rate, time taken) locally or in a simple cloud database.
    - This database will be the basis for your spaced repetition logic.
3. **Leitner System Logic**:
    - Implement a basic version of the Leitner system to prioritize problems.
    - For the MVP, the logic can be simplified. For instance: Box 1 (problems gotten wrong the first time), Box 2 (problems gotten wrong the second time), and Box 3 (problems solved).
4. **Review Notification/Reminder**:
    - An essential feature of spaced repetition is reminding the user to review. Implement a basic notification or reminder system based on the Leitner system's boxes.
    - This could be as simple as a daily reminder based on how many problems are in each box.
5. **Flashcards - Basic Version**:
    - Begin with simple, text-based flashcards that summarize key concepts of the problems the user attempted.
    - No need for complex card types or the mini code editor in the MVP.
6. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - This is crucial. Add a simple way for users to give feedback on the tool, report bugs, and suggest features.
    - This will help you understand what works and what doesn't and guide your subsequent development.
7. **User Onboarding & Tutorial**:
    - Even for an MVP, a brief user tutorial or onboarding can greatly increase user adoption.
    - This could be a series of tooltips, a short video, or even a one-page guide.
8. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy the MVP Chrome extension to a small group of beta testers, perhaps friends or members of online coding communities.
    - Use this beta test to identify any major issues, understand user behavior, and gather feedback.
9. **Iterate & Refine**:
    - Based on feedback and observations, iterate on the MVP.
    - Address bugs, make necessary improvements, and possibly add one or two features that are in high demand.
10. **Marketing & Outreach**:
    - Even for an MVP, a little marketing can go a long way. Share about your tool on platforms like Reddit (in coding or programming subreddits), Twitter, or other online communities.
    - The goal is not massive adoption but rather to get a significant number of users who can provide valuable feedback.

Remember, the goal of an MVP is to validate your product hypothesis, not to launch a full-featured product. Once you've gathered enough feedback and are confident about the product's potential, you can start adding more advanced features and refining the existing ones.
