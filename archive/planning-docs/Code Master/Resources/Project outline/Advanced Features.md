→ Staggered Levels 

1. with all resources 

1. with just notes 
2. with no resources 

Analyze how the problem is solved 

→ what data structure and algorithms are you utilizing 

→ after say it’s in the 5ths box we force user to use 

Another method for solving a another problem 

- how close is it to the optimal solution ?
- how would we reward that ? would that mean you have learn more ?
    
    wouldn’t that mean you have a better  understanding of that problem?
    
- How would be define mastery ? What are the targets ? to ultimately
    
    understand and utilize all common data structures and Algorithms 
    

How long does it take for a problem to be introduced for it go up to box level 5

Average length of session before Mastery  

Similar problems 

→ say I don’t want a hint but to be taken to a problem that is similar to the problem I am solving for 

→ there should be a map that will relate each problems to similar problems 

problem steps :

→ given an problem description what would be your steps 

→ what would some of your variables be ?
