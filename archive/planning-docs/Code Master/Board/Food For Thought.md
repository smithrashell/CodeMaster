🔍 So how do you know if you’re delaying unnecessarily?

Ask:

✅ Are the features I'm finalizing core to the first-time user experience?

✅ Would shipping without these features misrepresent what the app is trying to be?

✅ Will these changes prevent harmful or confusing behavior in the app?

If the answer is yes to any of those — it’s not delay. It’s due diligence.
